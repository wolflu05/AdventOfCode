# ðŸŽ„ Advent Of Code in Brainfuck

<img alt="Braingoat" height="40px" src="./lib/meta/logo.svg" />

A while ago I started a project called [braingoat](https://github.com/wolflu05/braingoat) which is a programming language that is made to be transpiled into valid brainfuck code.
This sub-folder contains solutions for puzzles written in brainfuck with the help of braingoat. Each solution has a `.bf` file containing the braingoat code and a `.b` file with the transpiled brainfuck code. If you want to test it yourself, just copy the brainfuck code (from the `.b` file) and run the program with your complete Advent of Code input ending with a new line. E.g. you can use the following brainfuck [web IDE](https://kvbc.github.io/bf-ide/). But note, that this is not that optimized so it can take some time until it finishes. Usual execution times are documented in a comment on the top in the `.bf` file. The first output line is the result for part 1, the second for part 2. If a result is just a `-` it means that this part is not implemented.
